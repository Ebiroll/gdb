Cross compiled gdb for use on arch linux,

	./configure --with-python=/usr/bin/python2.7 --without-guile --host=x86_64-build_pc-linux-gnu --target=xtensa-esp32-elf
	make

	

If you are building this for use with qemu, consider doing.

    cd gdb
    cp xtensa-config.c.qemu xtensa-config.c

When starting this copy of gdb consider starting with option
--data-directory ~/esp/qemu_esp32/gdb/


http://www.linuxfromscratch.org/blfs/view/cvs/general/gdb.html

cp /usr/bin/ar x86_64-build_pc-linux-gnu-ar


To install them (by default in /usr/local/bin, /usr/local/lib, etc),
then do:
	make install

(If the configure script can't determine your type of computer, give it
the name as an argument, for instance ``./configure sun4''.  You can
use the script ``config.sub'' to test whether a name is recognized; if
it is, config.sub translates it to a triplet specifying CPU, vendor,
and OS.)

If you have more than one compiler on your system, it is often best to
explicitly set CC in the environment before running configure, and to
also set CC when running make.  For example (assuming sh/bash/ksh):

	CC=gcc ./configure
	make

A similar example using csh:

	setenv CC gcc
	./configure
	make
